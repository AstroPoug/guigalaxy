description: >-
  Operating systems were indeed originally command/text-based. However, whilst the rise of GUIs would eventually supplement the command line interface (or CLI) in popularity, command lines nevertheless remained important and essential for advanced tasks and control. These command lines would thus be accessed in applications labeled variously as the "Command Prompt", "Terminal", and "Console". Nearly every GUI-based OS also includes a command line application, barring a few exceptions, most notably, classic Mac OS. As far as the command lines themselves, the two dominant types are the PC type (used by MS-DOS, Windows, and OS/2, among a couple others), and UNIX/POSIX (used by way too many OSes to count, but a couple notable being macOS, Linux, and even non-Unix OSes like BeOS have Unix-like syntax). However, some OSes indeed have bespoke and unique command lines, such as VMS, AmigaDOS, and TempleOS.
