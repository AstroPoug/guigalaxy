description: It has gone by various names - Recycle Bin, Trash, Wastebasket, even oddballs like Shredder and Dumpster. Regardless, there is one consitency, it serves as a place to put items you don't want anymore. In earlier OSes, namely command-based ones, deleting a program or file typically meant that file was seemingly gone forever, a permanent process (which often wasn't true in reality, the file system was merely marking it as empty so it could be overwritten, although if it was overwritten, the data would often indeed be irrecoverable). The trash can approach was first introduced in Lisa OS in 1983. However, its approach was fairly primitive. It accomplished the basic task of storing files to be deleted, but it was only capable of storing one document at a time. If another file was added, the previous file would be deleted for good. It wasn't until the following year's released of Mac OS that the modern idea of the trash can would really take hold - a place to store unwanted files, waiting their inevitable fate to either one day be restored, or be deleted for good (or hell, just sit there, collecting dust).

	OS/2's variant of the Recycle Bin, the Shredder, is a one-way operation, meaning, files deleted via the Shredder are deleted forever. As such, the OS doesn't have a Recycle Bin in the sense of a temporary location to store files.
