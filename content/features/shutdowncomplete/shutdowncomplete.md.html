title: "Shutdown Complete"

description: "In the 90s, computer operating systems were becoming more complex, and as this happened, it became necessary for operating systems to have to be shut down through a process, rather than simply powered down.
As a result, an OS would need time to be able to shut everything down, and only once it finished with everything was it safe for the user to power off the computer.
However, this stopped being necessary by the early 00s, with the introduction of ACPI on computers, allowing an operating system to power off the computer after it shuts down.
On Windows, the screen can still be manually enabled even on ACPI-compliant computers via the Group Policy, yet as Windows Vista required ACPI to run, for all practical purposes, the feature disappeared by the mid 00s."
