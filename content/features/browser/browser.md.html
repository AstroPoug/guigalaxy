description: "The first web browser, simply called WorldWideWeb, was created in Christmas of 1990. However, it took a few years for the web to fully catch on. The mid 90s was when the web really took off. Consequently, this was when operating systems began bundling browsers with them.
Some operating systems went with Netscape, particularly following the browser becoming open-source in 1998. However, most infamously, Microsoft began bundling IE with Windows in 1996, starting with the OSR 1 of Windows 95, and Windows NT 4.0. This played a key role in the decline in popularity of Netscape,
and let to accusations of anti-competitive practices, to the point Microsoft was sued by the government for it. IE gained further controversy over the years for its lack of following web standards and slow speeds. Additionally, even Mac OS, Windows competitor, began bundling Internet Explorer in 1998 following a deal made with Microsoft due to Apple's struggles in the 90s.
However, the 00s saw competitors to IE arise. For example, the Mozilla suite and then Firefox became the most common default browser on many Linux distros, whilst the KDE environment had its own browser called Konqueror, which introduced a new browser layout called KHTML. This would be forked by Apple into WebKit, which became the basis for their new browser, Safari, in 2003, following the end of their previously mentioned contract with Microsoft.
By the early 10s, Google would release Google Chrome, which would become the defualt browser of Google's operating systems Android and the aptly named Chrome OS, the latter being built around Chrome itself. It would eventually overtake IE to become the most popular browser in the world. Eventually, following further criticism and decline in popularity of IE, Microsoft would discontinue IE in 2015, replacing it with Edge in Windows 10.
Over the years, browsers would gain a variety of improvements, for example, tabbed browsing became common in web browsers in the mid 00s, making it much easier to have multiple web pages open, rather than every page needing to be in different windows. Google Chrome would popularize the Omnibar, which would eventually become standard in many browsers by the early 10s, in addition to a more minimalistic design for browsers."
